The purpose of this repo is for Azure Policy users and Microsoft internal teams to share and collaborate on custom policies. These policies are built either by customers or Microsoft Support engineers for customers. These are NOT Built-in policies hence are not check, tested or validated in any form by the Azure Policy Release Team. Please be wary of this and always TEST your policies before enforcing. Happy Coding!
