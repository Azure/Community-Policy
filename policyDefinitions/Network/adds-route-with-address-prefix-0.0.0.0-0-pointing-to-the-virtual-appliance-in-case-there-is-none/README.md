# Adds route with address prefix 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the virtual appliance in case there is none.

Adds route with address prefix 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the virtual appliance in case there is none. Best combined with policy [deny-route-nexthopvirtualappliance](https://github.com/Azure/Community-Policy/tree/master/Policies/Network/deny-route-nexthopvirtualappliance) to ensure the correct IP address of the virtual appliance.

Sample parameter ```routeTableSettings```, which can be used during policy assignment:
```json
{
    "northeurope": {
        "virtualApplianceIpAddress": "10.0.0.23"
    },
    "westeurope": {
        "virtualApplianceIpAddress": "10.1.0.23"
    },
    "disabled": {
        "virtualApplianceIpAddress": ""
    }
}
```

> Obviously, the location (e.g. ```northeurope```) is unknown during policy assignment and cannot be retrieved by ```parameters('routeTableSettings')[field('location')]``` in the policy definition. Hence, adding a ```disabled``` value to the parameter object is required to pass the validation during policy assignment.

## Notes
Route tables are location-specific resources, so depending on the location or Azure region of the VNet you need a different route table (e.g. North Europe, West Europe). For example, you cannot add a route table located in North Europe to a VNet's subnet located in West Europe. Additionally, virtual appliances are often deployed to different locations as well (e.g. North Europe, West Europe). For example, default routes (```0.0.0.0/0```) of route tables located in North Europe, should point to the virtual appliance in North Europe with IP address ```10.0.0.23```. For West Europe, they should point to ```10.1.0.23```. While this policy definition could be simplified and assigned once per location, reducing the amount of policy assignments improves manageability (e.g. reviewing audit results). Passing route table settings as a parameter object enables the usage of location-specific settings within the policy definition, e.g. ```[parameters('routeTableSettings')[field('location')].virtualApplianceIpAddress]``` with ```field('location')``` being the location where the VNet's subnet is located (e.g. North Europe, West Europe). Long story short, instead of doing _n_ policy assignments with _n_ being the amount of locations, you just need one single policy assignment. Pretty neat isn't it.
