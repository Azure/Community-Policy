### Notice
This policy differs from the one at https://github.com/Azure/Community-Policy/tree/master/Policies/Monitoring/deploy-diagnostic-setting-for-activity-log-log-analytics by the option to allow for different setting name.

This policy only validates the Log Analytics Target workspace value and not the setting name for it.
