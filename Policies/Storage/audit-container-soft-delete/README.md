This policy will audit if storage accounts have container soft delete enabled.

Container soft delete protects your data from being accidentally or erroneously modified or deleted. When container soft delete is enabled for a storage account, a container and its contents may be recovered after it has been deleted, within a retention period that you specify. For more details about container soft delete, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-container-overview.
