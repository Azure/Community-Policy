# Deploy NZISM Restricted policy initiative to Azure

## Initiatve and NZISM Version 3.6

This document covers how to deploy and use the NZ ISM Restricted Policy Initiative.  If you have any feedback or requests, please send them to <nzism@gcsb.govt.nz> or contact <bevan.sinclair@microsoft.com>.

## What is the NZISM Restricted Policy Initiative?

Up until recently, this initative and changes were published to this repo.  As of September 2024, the NZISM Restricted Policy Initiative is now available as a built-in Azure Policy.  This means that you can now deploy the NZISM Restricted Policy Initiative directly from the Azure Policy blade in the Azure portal.  The built-in version is aligned to version 3.7 of the NZISM, and will be continually updated as new versions of the NZISM are released.

Note also, the new built-in policy is available in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud console, and can be assigned to subscriptions and management groups in the same way as other built-in policies.

This version will be deprecated and no longer maintained.  Please use the built-in version.
